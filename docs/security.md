# 🔐 Security & Privacy

VeriMeZK is built with privacy and security at its core.

## 🧠 Core Principles

- **Client-side only**: No backend, no data storage

- **No tracking**: No analytics, no cookies, no fingerprinting

## 🛡️ Spoofing protection

- Liveness detection
- Biometric face match
- Document authenticity checks

---

## 🔒 Data handling

- All data stays in the browser
- No uploads, no logs, no cloud storage

---

## 🧪 Audits

- Codebase is open-source
- Smart contracts can be independently audited

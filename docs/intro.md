# Welcome to VeriMeZK Documentation

**VeriMeZK** is a lightweight, open-source toolkit for zero-knowledge identity verification. It enables users to prove attributes of their identity (like age or nationality) without revealing the underlying data — all processed locally, with optional on-chain verification via the **Midnight** blockchain.

## 🔍 What is VeriMeZK?

VeriMeZK allows developers to integrate privacy-preserving identity checks into their applications. It combines:

- Document scanning (e.g., passports, ID cards)
- Face verification with liveness detection
- Local generation of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs)
- Optional on-chain verification using Midnight

## ✨ Key Features

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Prove facts without revealing personal data
- **Client-Side Processing**: No data leaves the user’s device
- **Blockchain Integration**: Verify proofs on-chain using Midnight
- **Custom Checks**: Define your own logic (e.g., “is over 18”, “is from EU”)

## 🚀 Who is this for?

- Developers building privacy-first apps
- dApp creators needing KYC without data storage
- Anyone interested in decentralized identity and ZKPs
